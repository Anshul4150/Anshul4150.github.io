    "\n",
    "A pre-trained model is starting points for creating a model that can follow a specific instruction. However, the only difference is that a pretrained model is just trained on chunks of data but a instruction tuned model is fine tuned on instruction response , so it learns to generate response to instructions   :\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pre-trained Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training:** A pre-trained model is trained on a massive dataset of unlabeled text or data (like text or images) that covers a broad range of topics. This initial training helps the model develop a general understanding of language or the world. \n",
    "* **Focus:**  Think of it as learning the building blocks or foundational skills. It doesn't learn a specific task but develops a strong base for various tasks related to the type of data it's trained on. \n",
    "* **Benefits:** Pre-trained models are very efficient. They leverage the vast amount of data processed during pre-training, so you don't need to start from scratch when tackling a specific task. \n",
    "* **Drawback:** While versatile, they might not be perfect for a specific domain or task since the focus wasn't on that specific area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instruction-Tuned Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training:** An instruction-tuned model starts with a pre-trained model as a base. Then, it's further trained on a smaller dataset specifically designed for the desired task. This dataset often includes labeled examples with instructions or prompts about what the model should learn.  \n",
    "* **Focus:** This additional training refines the model's understanding to the specific task. It's like taking those building blocks and using them to construct something specific. \n",
    "* **Benefits:** Instruction-tuned models can achieve higher accuracy on a specific task compared to a pre-trained model used directly. \n",
    "* **Drawback:**  Tuning requires a task-specific dataset, and the success depends on the quality and size of that data. "

    "**Creating the Prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Response:** `system` contains a message praising your Python coding skills.\n",
    "2. **User Request:** `user` specifies the request to \"Write a Python code to display text in a star pattern.\"\n",
    "3. **Prompt Construction:** `prompt` combines the system response, user request, and an AI response placeholder using f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization and Model Input Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenizer:** `tokenizer` likely refers to a pre-trained tokenizer function from the Hugging Face Transformers library, converting the text in the prompt into numerical representations for the LLM.\n",
    "2. **Tensor Conversion:** `.to(\"cuda\")` converts the tokenized prompt into a PyTorch tensor, moving it to the GPU (if available) for faster processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Generation:** `model.generate` utilizes the LLM to generate text following the prompt. Arguments specify:\n",
    "    * `inputs`: Tokenized prompt as input.\n",
    "    * `num_return_sequences`: Set to 1, indicating one generated sequence.\n",
    "    * `max_new_tokens`: Limits maximum generated tokens to 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding and Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decoding:** `tokenizer.decode` converts the generated token sequence into human-readable text.\n",
    "2. **Splitting and Markdown:** Code splits generated text by \"Response:\" to extract the response, wrapping it in a Markdown object, likely for formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Functionality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet simulates a conversation where the user asks for Python code for a star pattern, and the LLM generates the code using the prompt and its knowledge.\n",

    "# **4. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a paradigm in language model architecture that integrates both retrieval and generation processes to enhance the model's understanding and response capabilities. It combines the strengths of retrieval-based models, which excel at accessing and utilizing external knowledge sources, with generative models, which can generate novel and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Benefits of RAG in Large Language Models (LLMs):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** By retrieving relevant information from external sources, RAG better understands the input context, leading to more contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Improved Content Quality:** Integrating external knowledge sources allows RAG to generate more accurate, informative, and relevant content, enhancing the overall quality of generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factually Accurate Responses:** Accessing external knowledge bases ensures that RAG's responses are factually accurate and grounded in real-world information, reducing the likelihood of generating misleading or incorrect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow of RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval:** The model retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base or corpus based on the input prompt or query.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Augmentation:** The retrieved information augments the model's understanding of the input context.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Generation:** The model generates a response based on the augmented understanding of the input context, leveraging both the original prompt and the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessity of Using RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG addresses the limitations of traditional generative models, such as lack of factual accuracy and coherence in responses. By integrating retrieval-based mechanisms, RAG accesses external knowledge sources to enhance its understanding of the input context, leading to more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant generated text. This approach is particularly valuable in tasks requiring a deep understanding of complex topics or access to large knowledge bases, such as question answering, dialogue generation, and content summarization.\n"

    "**Title:** Towards Data Science Medium Articles Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:** \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a comprehensive collection of blog posts sourced from Medium, focusing specifically on articles published under the \"Towards Data Science\" publication. It consists of two primary columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Title:** Contains the title of each blog post, providing a concise summary of the content and facilitating tasks such as title-based classification, keyword extraction, and trend analysis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Text:** Contains the full text content of each blog post, offering detailed information and insights on various topics in Data Science. This column serves as a valuable resource for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, information extraction, text generation, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset offers a comprehensive view of the current discourse within the Towards Data Science community on Medium. It enables the exploration of trends, popular topics, and the evolution of Data Science over time. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of NLP, providing ample opportunities for data exploration, model training, and algorithm development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use in RAG:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The Towards Data Science Medium Articles Dataset serves as a rich source of external knowledge for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). By leveraging the vast array of blog posts contained within the dataset, RAG models can retrieve relevant information to augment their understanding of input prompts or queries, leading to more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant generated responses. This dataset facilitates the integration of external knowledge sources into the generation process, enhancing the capabilities of RAG models in producing high-quality text outputs.\n"

       "\n",
       "- Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that finds extrebounds (or minima) of a function.\n",
       "- It works by iteratively updating the parameters of the model in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Connection with Backpropagation:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Backpropagation is the process of calculating the gradients of a loss function with respect to the model parameters.\n",
       "- It's an essential part of training supervised machine learning models, where we need to update the model parameters to minimize the loss function.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it works: (The process of finding gradients)**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Calculate the gradients:**\n",
       "    - We need to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter.\n",
       "    - This involves traversing over the training data and measuring how each parameter contributes to the loss.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Update the parameters:**\n",
       "    - We update each parameter in the opposite direction of its gradient.\n",
       "    - The amount of update is typically controlled by a learning rate, which determines how much we trust the gradient.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Iterate until convergence:**\n",
       "    - We repeat steps 1-2 until the loss function reaches a minimum.\n",
       "    - This process is called \"training\" or \"learning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**In the context of machine learning, backpropagation is used to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. This information is then used to update the parameters and improve the model's performance.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key features of backpropagation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- It's a recursive algorithm, meaning it repeatedly calculates the gradients of the loss function.\n",
       "- It's efficient and widely used in machine learning models.\n",
       "- It's essential for training supervised models.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Applications of gradient descent and backpropagation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Training supervised machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, classification models)\n",
       "- Optimizing functions in various domains (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing)\n",
       "- Solving linear systems and solving linear equations."
